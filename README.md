# Clojure-CSS

### Goals

A Clojure wrapper to CSS.

CSS is composed of lists of tags/classes/IDs with nested attributes and values (e.g. `color: red;`). Being Turing-complete, Clojure allows all sorts of nicities for complex calculations (with hex or angles, for example.)

**Clojure-CSS. It's what the people want.**
