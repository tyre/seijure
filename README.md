# Seijure - Clojure to CSS

### Goals

A Clojure wrapper to CSS.

CSS is composed of lists of tags/classes/IDs with nested attributes and values (e.g. `color: red;`). Being Turing-complete, Clojure allows all sorts of nicities for complex calculations (with hex or angles, for example.)

**Seijure. It hurts to think about.**


Thank you to the #clojure IRC for all of their help, especially dnolan and amalloy
